- 👋 Hi, I’m Nike, @niketamm
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new skills for coding, finance, Japan, tasty food from different cultures and languages(I`m fluent in 4).
- 🌱 I started my coding journey in 2021 by enrolling in SheCodes online workshop where I finished 4 projects. 2 of them with html, css and Javascript and use of weather API and Bootstrap to build a weather app. 2 other projects were weather app coded with React and dictionary application that uses 2 APIs, one for English dictionary and another to find photos according to the word searched. 
Currently I`m focusing on developing and maintaining skills learned to build more apps. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner level projects to get experience and help out with basic coding.
