-Hi, I’m Nike, @niketamm

-I’m interested in learning new things. I have self-taught myself how to do digital art. Besides coding I love langauges (fluent in 4), Japanese culture- I moved to Japan apart from my family 10 years ago to study in high school with zero Japanese knowledge and graduated!- I especially like tea ceremony, traditional dances and arts. 

-I started my proper coding journey in 2021 by enrolling in SheCodes online workshop where I finished 4 projects. 

Why coding in front-end? My informal journey started from creating layouts in a kids website by self teaching myself basics of html and css at age of 12. This is also when I learned a lot of English, which is not my native langauge. With online communities back then, I also found myself immersed with Japan enthusiasts so I took a break from computer world, graduated high school in Japan, went to university to study international management and meet other interationals in Japan and here I am now on github :)

- 2 projects: html, css and Javascript including use of API and Bootstrap. 
- 2 projects: html, css, React, API, Node.js and Bootstrap. One project is a simple weather app while another is English dictionary with image gallery carousel. 

Currently I`m focusing on developing and maintaining skills learned to build more apps. 

- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on projects to get experience and help out with basic coding.
